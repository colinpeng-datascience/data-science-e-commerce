# Data Science Applications in E-commerce

This repository contains sample code and documentation for data analysis and machine learning applications suitable for an e-commerce context, as well as broadly for any business needing sophisticated text analysis and natural language processing.

## Models

### 1. Text Pair Verification Model (`verify_pair.ipynb`)

The Jupyter notebook included shows a model intended to assess the correspondence between a keyword and a sentence. This model employs dual encoder Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for encoding, and introduces a connection resembling residual networks to preserve the keyword context during sentence processing. One can also modify the encoders to pre-trained BERT models for exploiting the pre-trained features.

### 2. Keyword Extraction Model (`keyword_extract.ipynb`)

This notebook outlines a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model enhanced with an Attention mechanism, aimed at keyword extraction from texts. The application is typical in various data analysis initiatives.
